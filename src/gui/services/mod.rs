//! Provides a suite of services that encapsulate the application's business logic for the GUI.
//!
//! This module follows a service-oriented approach, where each service is
//! responsible for a specific domain of functionality, such as managing popups,
//! handling search, or providing core application data. The `Services` struct
//! acts as a container to conveniently pass all services throughout the UI.
