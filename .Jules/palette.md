## 2024-05-23 - [Selection Clear Buttons]
**Learning:** Users often select an item (like an airport or aircraft) and then want to "reset" their choice to a random or unspecified state. Requiring them to open the dropdown and find a "None" or "Unspecified" option is tedious. A direct "Clear" (X) button next to the selection provides immediate control and visibility of the "unselected" state.
**Action:** When designing selection components, always consider the "deselect" workflow. If a selection can be cleared, provide a visible, one-click action to do so without opening a menu.
