## 2024-05-23 - [Selection Clear Buttons]
**Learning:** Users often select an item (like an airport or aircraft) and then want to "reset" their choice to a random or unspecified state. Requiring them to open the dropdown and find a "None" or "Unspecified" option is tedious. A direct "Clear" (X) button next to the selection provides immediate control and visibility of the "unselected" state.
**Action:** When designing selection components, always consider the "deselect" workflow. If a selection can be cleared, provide a visible, one-click action to do so without opening a menu.

**Learning:** Technical acronyms (like ICAO) and domain-specific terms (like Flight Rules) in data tables can be barriers for new users. Tooltips on headers allow providing definitions and context right where the user looks, without cluttering the visual design.
**Action:** Add explanatory tooltips to all table headers that use acronyms or domain-specific terminology.
