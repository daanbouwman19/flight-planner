## 2024-05-23 - Immediate Mode State Management
**Learning:** In this `egui` application, ViewModels (like `RoutePopupViewModel`) are reconstructed every frame in `Gui::update`. To persist UI state (like a button being disabled after a click) while keeping the window open, the state must be stored in the underlying service (e.g., `PopupService`) and passed to the ViewModel, rather than trying to store it in the component itself.
**Action:** When adding interactive state to a component that needs to persist beyond a single frame, always add the state field to the corresponding Service struct and expose it to the ViewModel construction in `Gui::update`.
