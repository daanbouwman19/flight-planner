**Learning:** Plain text errors in popups are easily missed. Users scan for colors (red) and icons (⚠️) to identify issues quickly. A consistent visual language for "Close" actions (e.g., using ❌) improves learnability across the application.
**Action:** Always couple error text with a distinct color and an icon to differentiate it from informational content. Ensure action buttons use consistent iconography.
