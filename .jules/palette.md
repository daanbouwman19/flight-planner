## 2026-01-12 - [Visual Hierarchy in Error States]
**Learning:** Plain text errors in popups are easily missed. Users scan for colors (red) and icons (⚠️) to identify issues quickly. A consistent visual language for "Close" actions (e.g., using ❌) improves learnability across the application.
**Action:** Always couple error text with a distinct color and an icon to differentiate it from informational content. Ensure action buttons use consistent iconography.

## 2026-01-15 - [Dynamic Tooltips for Stateful Actions]
**Learning:** Static tooltips on toggle buttons (like "Show/Hide") force users to guess the current state or the result of the action. Dynamic tooltips (e.g., "Show" when hidden, "Hide" when visible) reduce cognitive load and provide clear confirmation of the next action.
**Action:** For any toggleable UI element (show/hide, mute/unmute, play/pause), always ensure the tooltip text reflects the *action that will happen* upon clicking, not just a description of the button's purpose.
