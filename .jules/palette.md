**Learning:** Adding direct links to external tools (SkyVector, Google Maps) in context (Route Popup) significantly enhances the utility for flight simmers without cluttering the UI, thanks to `egui`'s compact `hyperlink_to`.
**Action:** Look for other places where context-specific external links can be added (e.g., aircraft details -> Wikipedia/Skybrary).
